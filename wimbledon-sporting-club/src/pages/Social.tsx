      <p className='para'>Our first Christmas Party was held at the Wimbledon Irish Centre. Big shoutout to Sheila for hosting us and putting up with all of us! 
      <br></br> <br></br>Laughs were had, drinks were drunk and prizes were won. <br></br><br></br> This year we had a signed Fulham FC jersey from all the current squad players of 2023/24 season - along with other prizes such as vouchers for local restaurants and of course some priceless WSC memorobilia. </p>

<section className='banner banner3'>
  <div className='specs-container'>
<p className='para specs'> Summer 2023 marked the establishment of our football club - and we wanted to celebrate the milestone with a trip away.  <br></br>
With a few lads on the team from Galway in Ireland - it was a natural flow to get the cheapest Ryanair flights out there. <br></br><br></br> We hiked Diamond Hill, swam in Silverstrand and played the local Salthill Devon FC in a friendly winning 4-0. </p>
