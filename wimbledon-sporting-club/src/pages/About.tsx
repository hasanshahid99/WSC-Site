      <section className='banner sml'>
        <p className="para">Our club would not exist if it wasnâ€™t for the sponsorships we received from local businesses. So, in order to give back to the community we take part in volunteering efforts across SW London.
    
          <br />
          <br />
          We partner with ADBC and Enable. There has been great interest received from our players with getting involved for these events - so it has allowed us to schedule multiple efforts throughout the season.    </p>
